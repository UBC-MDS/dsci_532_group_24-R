# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
For the DSCI 532 project, group 24 is committed to forming a friendly and effective team environment in which members are expected to learn, practice and accomplish project tasks. Aside from striving to finish academic goals, we hereby list a set of guidelines that gravitate us towards working as an ethical, respectful and coherent team. 

We acknowledge that we should strictly follow [UBC](https://students.ubc.ca/campus-life/student-code-conduct) and [MDS](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/code_of_conduct/) rules and codes of conduct. 

## Fundamental Guidelines
- This group is project-focused, therefore anyone's work should be evaluated solely based on its merit, rather than on one's background.
- As tasks are equally and fairly distributed, every teammate has the right to express their opinions and suggestions.
- Teammates must be respectful and honest with each other, while being prompt and direct to ensure proper communication.
- We have no tolerance for plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct.

## Freedom of speech and diversity of opinions
We see the project as an opportunity to discuss real-world issues through the lens of data science and analytics and believe that the freedom of thoughts and speech is essential to the success of this project, and higher education in general. 
We encourage a diversity of perspectives and opinions, and candid expression and civil competition thereof, especially regarding public and social issues that potentially will become factors to be considered in the project. 

We appreciate the diversity of team members' personalities and backgrounds. Their gender, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, and religion should be respected.   

## Standards
- **Examples of encouraged behaviours include:**
	- Focusing on what is best for the group as a whole
	- Being respectful and kind to teammates
	- Being humble and open-minded when accepting criticism from teammates
	- Thinking from teammates' perspective and provoke mutual understanding
	- Assisting others when they have troubles in a specific task

- **Examples of unacceptable behaviours include:**
	- Verbally insulting teammates under any circumstances
	- Dodging responsibilities and picking the easy way out to cause a burden on the rest of the teammate 
	- Copying others' work without permission and references
	- Judging others because their work is deemed unsatisfiable
	- Revealing unauthorized private information of others, such as their phone numbers, home addresses, etc


## Enforcement
In case untolerated behaviors take place, team-members should be proactive in explaining to colleagues why their behavior is considered inappropriate. 
Team-members who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior should comply immediately. 
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, team members can report it to the MDS teaching team and leadership. 

#### **Reporting guideline**  
If someone violates this Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the DSCI 532 Instructor(s). The current instructor is Joel Ostblom. An email to [joel.ostblom@ubc.ca](mailto:joel.ostblom@ubc.ca) will be seen by Joel Ostblom. Alternatively, you may contact Analise Hofmann, the Teaching Assistant in charge of our group.
