|---------------------|-----------------|
| Junghoo Kim         | jkim222383      |

This document governs how team members will work together through friendly, close, and efficient communication. 

## Schedules and deadlines:
- Meet every Friday at 4:00- 5:00pm PST.

We believe that efficient meetings are the cornerstone of success at this course and collaborative projects at MDS in general. We highly value the skills that we obtain from organizing and participating in meetings for this course. 

- Meet to make release 3pm Saturday to give a buffer before deadline.

- Let the group know of any black out dates, or schedule conflicts you have 3 days in advance

It is completely legitimate for team-members to experience difficulties in the project itself, or for other academic and personal reasons. 
Under such circumstances, team-members should communicate as soon as possible with the whole team, so that necessary adjustments can be made. 
The team should be understanding of such circumstances. 
Team members are encouraged to pick up extra work, and the team should show appreciation. 

- If a person depends on your work, aim to have it done a few days early.

## Communication:
- Communications among group members should be conducted primarily through Github Issues. Slack is only for informal communication and its use should be limited. 

- Issues to fix should be stored as a Github Issue.

- Try to have your work reasonably tidy before presenting it to the group to make it easier to understand.

## Responsibilities:
- Team members are expected to work on the project for at least 10 hours per week. 
    
Expect to work primarily during scheduled labs and lectures.
We acknowledge that sometimes extra time and effort is needed for the project. However, we believe that team-members should also balance other MDS commitments and their overall health. 
The team should acknowledge extra work and effort made by team-members, and generously share appreciation. 

- Divide up the work at the start of each week.

- Group will agree on division of work for each milestone.

- Each member should take turns doing all types of work.

## Attitudes:

- Be open to constructive criticism and be respectful when giving it.

- It is OK to ask for help if you need it.

- Be mindful of the correct use of Github forks with appropriate committing and pushing operations, and have strong attention to team members' work, and seeking, providing, and appreciating constructive feedback.

## Decision making and conflict resolution:

- Major decisions made by vote

- Use a common toolset so that all parts of the project are accessible to everyone. 

- Disputes that need mediation will be mediated by course instructor Joel Ostblom.

## Coding Etiquette:

- Aim for a working version first and improve on the working version iteratively

- When needed, include brief comments for long, complex chunks of code

- Include TODO notes as placeholders for future tasks (e.g. docstrings, test cases)

- When refining othersâ€™ codes, check to make sure nothing is broken afterwards and explain why the changes were needed?

## Unavailability:

- Mark is not available before 1pm Vancouver time. 

- Junghoo is not available on Fridays 8 am - 4 pm.

- Eric is generally available in the evening, and on Fridays and Saturdays.
